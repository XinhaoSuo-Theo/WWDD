# Precipitation Concentration Analysis Code
This repository contains Python code used to generate figures for the study:
"Investigating the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Precipitation Concentration and Their Associated Risks" ( Scientific Reports).

Code Description
The code performs spatial and temporal analysis of precipitation concentration patterns and associated risks, producing publication-quality visualizations including:

1.spatial Gini coefficient and its trend
2.Current temporal Gini coefficient and its trend

Main Scripts
fig.1.py: Calculates and maps Spatial gini coefficient 
fig.2 py:  Calculates and maps Temporal gini coefficient 
fig.3 and fig.4 py: Specific analysis of the time-scale GINI coefficient (including the spatial distribution and trend changes on rainy days and non-rainy days) and the differences in the risk of WWDD faced by different regions under the joint analysis of time and space


Requirements
Python packages needed:
numpy, pandas，matplotlib, seaborn，xarray, cartopy (for geospatial plots),scipy, statsmodels (for statistical analysis),regionmask
